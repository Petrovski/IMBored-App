# IMBored (IMB) App

The IMBored (IMB) App is an app that allows you to fill out a simple form of questions that pertain to what you might be interested in doing. These include questions such as location, free or fee, outside or inside, etc.
Based on your answers, the app will provide you with suggestions on things to do. Along with this, it will provide route data from your current location, and the weather in the area that you are going to be going to when you click on the result that we provided. This will provide much needed info to help you make your decision on not being bored anymore!

Front-End Teams: Alex and Kellie

Back-End Teams: Nyjah and Chris

We will all review each otherï¿½s code, this is just a start to the roles of teach team members. 

Technologies used will include Google Maps API, and inside that API we will be using places, location, routes, and a few other APIs. We will also be using a weather API as well. The layout will most likely include bootstrap, and some different front-end technologies that Alex and Kellie will research on.

Day 1: Idea for app agreed upon team, initial wireframe created, members and roles assigned, technologies going to be used figured out, description and readme made.

Day 2: Create initial layout, acquire all API information needed.
