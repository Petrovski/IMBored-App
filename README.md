# IMBored (IMB) App

The IMBored (IMB) App is an app that allows you to fill out a simple form of questions that pertain to what you might be interested in doing. These include questions such as location, free or fee, outside or inside, etc.
Based on your answers, the app will provide you with suggestions on things to do. Along with this, it will provide route data from your current location, and the weather in the area that you are going to be going to when you click on the result that we provided. This will provide much needed info to help you make your decision on not being bored anymore!
